data_inputs: ILI%
methods: Seasonal naive forecasts with Box-Cox variance stabilization and bootstrapped residual prediction intervals via fable generate().
methods_long: Uses SNAIVE() with a yearly lag and Box-Cox transformation (lambda estimated via guerrero method per location) to forecast weekly weighted ILI percentages. Prediction intervals are generated from 1000 bootstrapped residual paths using fable generate(bootstrap=TRUE), with empirical quantiles extracted at 23 levels. Forecasted values are floored at zero to ensure non-negativity.
